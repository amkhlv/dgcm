Differential Geometry and Classical Mechanics
=============================================

Here is the source code for the [notes for a course](http://andreimikhailov.com/teaching/gdmc/index.html) 
which I am giving at [IFT UNESP](http://www.ift.unesp.br).


This is only partial, and work in progress. 

To compile, use [BystroTeX](http://andreimikhailov.com/slides/bystroTeX/slides-manual/index.html).

Some files are symlinks:  `build.rkt`, `cleanup.rkt`, and the `css` files.
They can be found [here](https://github.com/amkhlv/usr/tree/master/share/scribble)
