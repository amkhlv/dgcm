A topological space is a @bold{set with some additional structure}, which allows to say
which functions are continuos and which are not.

@div[comment]{
The solution is somewhat surprizing: in order to describe continuity, one defines the notion of
@bold{open set}. The additional structure (called ``topology'') describes a subset of the set of all 
subsets of @f{X}, which are considered @bold{open}. This subset should satisfy certain properties:
@tg[ol]{
@tg[li]{The union of open sets is an open set.}

sets are unions of open intervals @f{a<x<b}. Function @f{f} is considered @bold{continuous} iff

Why do we need to formalize obvious things?
@linebreak[]
Of course, the standard answer is: @bold{in order to be mathematically rigorous}.
@linebreak[]
But I think there is also another reason, somewhat psychological.
There are foundational concepts, which come up again and again in our study of the nature.
It is useful to ``package'' them in a concise and standartized form:
@tg[ol]{
@tg[li]{So that researchers have common language}
@tg[li]{By training ourselves in using these ``packages'' as standard blocks, we could
perhaps learn to think faster}

Of course it is important to return to these fundamental concepts, because sometimes 
there are surprizes. It turns out that there are infinitely many smooth manifolds which
are all topologically equivalent to @f{{\bf R}^4}.

As you can see from @seclink["Potato"]{the potato picture}, an atlas is a rather elaborate
(cumbersome?) construction.

But actually, we only need a very limited piece of information from it. The atlas in all its detail
is way too much. So, we will introduce some sort of equivalence relation on atlases: two atlases
are considered @bold{equivalent}, when they provide the @bold{same essential data}. 

So, what is this essential data?

@spn[attn]{Category} is a very important mathematical notion. It is similar to a group, but a bit weaker.

A @bold{group} is a set of elements which can be multiplied; if @f{f} and @f{g} are two elements of a group,
then we can form their product @f{f\circ g}. The product is associative:
@equation{
f\circ(g\circ h) = (f\circ g)\circ h
}
There is a unit element @f{\bf 1} such that @f{{\bf 1}\circ f = f}.  Also, for every @f{g} there is
an inverse @f{g^{-1}} such that @f{g^{-1}\circ g={\bf 1}}.

A @bold{category} @f{\cal C} has a weaker definition than a group, in the following way. 
Not any two elements can be multiplied. In fact, every
element of a category carries two labels, an in-label and and out-label. A product (or composition)
@f{F\circ G} is only defined when the in-label of @f{F} is the same as the out-label of @f{G}.

The elements of the category are called ``morphisms''.
The labels run over a set which is called @f{{\rm Ob}\;{\cal C}} --- ``the set of objects''.
The set of all morphisms which have in-label @f{A} and out-label @f{B} is called  @f{{\rm Mor}(A,B)}.
Therefore, if @f{F\in {\rm Mor}(A,B)} and @f{G\in {\rm Mor}(B,C)}, @bold{then} we can take their
product @f{G\circ F}. There should exist @f{{\bf 1}_{A}\in {\rm Mor}(A,A)} for every @f{A\in{\rm Ob}\;{\cal C}}.
 
@div[comment]{
An example of a category is the set of all rectangular matrices. 
In this case @f{{\rm Ob}\;{\cal C} = \{1,2,3,\ldots\}} and @f{{\rm Mor}(m,n)} is
the set of all matrices with @f{n} rows and @f{m} columns. The composition is the product of matrices.
}

A @bold{functor} between two categories is the analogue of @bold{homomorphism} between two groups:
@tabular[@list[
 @list[
@hspace[4]@f{{\cal F}: {\rm Ob} {\cal C} \to {\rm Ob} {\cal D}} ""
]@list[
@hspace[4]@f{{\cal F}: {\rm Mor}(A,B) \to {\rm Mor}({\cal F}(A),{\cal F}(B))} @elem{@hspace[3](the same letter @f{{\cal F}} is used)}
]
]]
such that @f{{\cal F}(F\circ G) = {\cal F}(F)\circ {\cal F}(G)}.

@linebreak[]
Smooth maps between manifolds form a category, let us denote it @f{{\cal M}}. In this case
@f{{\rm Ob}\;{\cal M}} is the set of all smooth manifolds, and 
@f{{\rm Mor}\;(M,N)} is the set of all smooth maps between @f{M} and @f{N}.

The construction of tangent bundle is an example of a functor, from @f{{\cal M}} to @f{{\cal M}}
(in fact, it is a functor from the category of smooth manifolds to the category of vector bundles;
we will discuss vector bundles later). For every manifold @f{M}, we get @f{TM}. And for every
map @f{F}, we get @f{F_*} which would be better to denote @f{TF}:

@div[redbox]{
For a derivative of a smooth map @f{F}, we will sometimes use the notation @f{TF\;} instead of @f{F_*}
This operation respects the composition of morphisms, as a functor should --- see Eq. (@ref{DerivativeRespectsComposition})
}
