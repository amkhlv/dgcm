@bold{General topology.} 
is a mathematical game, which captures the notion of @bold{continuity}.
A topological space is a @bold{set with some additional structure}, which allows to say
which functions are continuos and which are not.

@div[comment]{
The solution is somewhat surprizing: in order to describe continuity, one defines the notion of
@bold{open set}. The additional structure (called ``topology'') describes a subset of the set of all 
subsets of @f{X}, which are considered @bold{open}. This subset should satisfy certain properties:
@tg[ol]{
@tg[li]{The union of open sets is an open set.}
@tg[li]{The finite intersection of open sets is an open set.}
@tg[li]{@f{X} and the empty set @f{\emptyset} are open sets.}

sets are unions of open intervals @f{a<x<b}. Function @f{f} is considered @bold{continuous} iff
@f{f^{-1}(\mbox{open set}) = \mbox{open set}}.

Why do we need to formalize obvious things?
@linebreak[]
Of course, the standard answer is: @bold{in order to be mathematically rigorous}.
@linebreak[]
But I think there is also another reason, somewhat psychological.
There are foundational concepts, which come up again and again in our study of the nature.
It is useful to ``package'' them in a concise and standartized form:
@tg[ol]{
@tg[li]{So that researchers have common language}
@tg[li]{By training ourselves in using these ``packages'' as standard blocks, we could
perhaps learn to think faster}

Of course it is important to return to these fundamental concepts, because sometimes 
there are surprizes. It turns out that there are infinitely many smooth manifolds which
are all topologically equivalent to @f{{\bf R}^4}.

@slide["Tangent space: coordinates" #:tag "TangentSpaceInCoordinates" #:showtitle #t]{
First of all, a bit of notations. As we explained, any smooth trajectory @f{f(t)} defines a
velocity vector, as an equivalence class of this @f{f(t)} modulo the equivalence relations (@ref{oSmallOft}). 
The equivalence class is usually denoted @f{[f]}. But we find this notation ugly in our case.
Instead, we will write:
@equation[#:label "VectorDotNotation"]{
\dot{f}(0)\;\;\mbox{ \small or even }\;\; {df\over dt}(0)
}
--- this is the same as @f{[f]}, @italic{i.e.} the velocity vector corresponding to the trajectory.

Let us study the component notations (@ref{VectorComponentNotation}) in some detail. The components
of the vector on the RHS of (@ref{VectorComponentNotation}) is simply the coordinates of the 
point @f{\phi^{-1}(f(t))}. A more interesting object is @spn[attn]{coordinates of the vector}:
@equation[#:label "CoordinatesOfVector"]{
\dot{f}(0) = \left(
\begin{array}{c}
\left.{df^1(t)\over dt}\right|_{t=0} \cr \ldots \cr \left.{df^n(t)\over dt}\right|_{t=0}
\end{array}
\right)

To fix a tangent vector, we have to fix @f{n} components 
@equation[#:label "VComponents"]{
v^1 = \left.{df^1(t)\over dt}\right|_{t=0},\;\;\ldots\;\;,\; v^n = \left.{df^n(t)\over dt}\right|_{t=0}
}
--- these numbers @f{v_1,\ldots,v_n} are called ``components of the vector''.
}

@slide["Tangent space is a linear space" #:tag "TangentSpaceLinearStructure" #:showtitle #t]{
The set of all tangent vectors to @f{M} at the point @f{x} has a natural structure of a linear space,
@italic{i.e.} we can define the operation of summation:
@equation[#:label "LinearStructure"]{
[f_1] + [f_2] \stackrel{\rm\small def}{=} [\phi( \phi^{-1}\circ f_1 + \phi^{-1}\circ f_2 )] 
}
The right hand side is the definition of the opearation ``@f{+}''. When we do ``@f{+}'' on the right
hand side we just sum the coordinates of @f{\phi^{-1}\circ f_1} and @f{\phi^{-1}\circ f_2} 
@italic{i.e.} we compute the sum of components @f-2{f_1^k + f_2^k} as defined in 
(@ref{VectorComponentNotation}).

@bold{Potential problem:} 
On the left hand side, we are trying to define something depending on @bold{equivalence class}
of @f{f_1} and @bold{equivalence class} of @f{f_2}. However, the right hand side @italic{a priori}
depends on @f{f_1} and @f{f_2} themselves (and not just on their corresponding equivalence classes!)
That's why we need:

@bold{Exercise @ex-num{LinearStructureCorrectlyDefined}:} 
Show that the expression on the right hand side, actually, does not change if we replace @f{f_1}
and @f{f_2} with @f{g_1} and @f{g_2} where @f{g_1} is equivalent to @f{f_1} and @f{g_2} to @f{f_2}
in the sense of (@ref{oSmallOft}).

Also, show that this definition of ``@f{+}'' does not change if we pass from a chart
@f{\phi} to another chart @f{\tilde{\phi}}.

@bold{In terms of components} @f{v^1,\ldots,v^n} defined as in (@ref{VComponents}) the 
operation ``@f{+}'' is obvious:
@equation{
\left(\begin{array}{c} 
v_1^1 + v_2^1 \cr
v_1^2 + v_2^2 \cr
v_1^3 + v_2^3 \cr
\ldots \cr
v_1^n + v_2^n

There is a very similar definition of the multiplication by a number @f{\lambda\in {\bf R}}:
@equation{
\lambda\cdot[f] \stackrel{\rm\small def}{=} [\phi( \lambda\phi^{-1}\circ f)]
}
which becomes @f{(\lambda v^1,\ldots,\lambda v^n)} in components.

@slide["Tangent bundle" #:tag "TangentBundle" #:showtitle #t]{
For any point @f{x\in M}, we can consider the corresponding tangent space. It is denoted:
@equation{
T_xM  \;\; \mbox{\small --- the tangent space to }M\mbox{ \small at the point }x

Let us consider the union (as in set theory) of all these @f{T_xM} over all @f{x\in M}.
This turns out to be a @bold{smooth manifold of dimension} @f{2n}, the ``tangent bundle of @f{M}'':
@equation{
TM = \bigcup\limits_{x\in M} T_xM  \;\; \mbox{\small --- the tangent bundle of }M
}
The point of @f{TM} is a pair @f{(x,v)} where @f{x\in M} and @f{v\in T_xM}.

If we have a chart @f{\phi:U\to M}, covering @f{x}, then we can parametrize @f{(x,v)} by @f{2n}
numbers:
@equation[#:label "XandV"]{
(x^1,\ldots x^n\;,\;\; v^1,\ldots,v^n)
}
Indeed, the definitions of @f{x^i} and @f{v^i} are:
@equation{
\left(\begin{array}{c}
x^1\cr \ldots \cr x^n
\end{array}\right) = \phi(x) \;\;\mbox{ and } \;\;
\left(\begin{array}{c}

\left.{\partial f^n(t)\over \partial t}\right|_{t=0}

This gives a straightforward description of a part of @f{TM}:
@equation[#:label "TMOverChart"]{
\bigcup\limits_{x\in \phi(U)}T_xM = U\times {\bf R}^n
}
Notice that @f{M} is totally covered by charts @f{U_i}. And, as we have just explained, for every
chart we have a fairly straightforward description (@ref{TMOverChart}) of @f{TM}. 
Therefore we obtain a fairly concrete description of @f{TM}, except for one important detail which 
we have to figure out:

@div[redbox]{

point of @f{TM}, only from the point of view of two different charts?

@slide["Tangent bundle: transition functions" #:tag "TangentBundleTransitionFunctions" #:showtitle #t]{
Investigation of this issue leads to the notion of ``transition functions''. 

The relation between @f{(x^1,\ldots x^n)} and @f{(\tilde{x}^1,\ldots,\tilde{x}^n)} we already know.
When we have two charts @f{\phi:U\to M} and @f{\widetilde{\phi}:\widetilde{U}\to M}, we get a ``gluing function'' 
@f{\tau} as in Eq. (@ref{DefTau}):
@equation{
\tau = \tilde{\phi}^{-1}\circ\phi
}
This @f{\tau} is a function from @f{U\in {\bf R}^n} to @f{\widetilde{U}\in {\bf R}^n}, therefore it
has @f{n} components @f{\tau^1,\ldots,\tau^n}, each component being a function of @f{n} variables. We have:
@equation{
\tilde{x}^1 = \tau^1(x^1,\ldots,x^n)\;,\;\ldots\;,\;
\tilde{x}^n = \tau^n(x^1,\ldots,x^n)
}
But what is the relation between @f{(v^1,\ldots,v^n)} and @f{(\tilde{v}^1,\ldots \tilde{v}^n)}? 
Suppose we have a trajectory @f{f(t)}, and the coordinate functions of the trajectory  in the chart @f{U}
are @f{f^1(t),\ldots,f^n(t)}. The components @f{v^j} of the corresponding tangent vector are given by
Eq. (@ref{VComponents}).
Then the coordinate functions of the same trajectory in the chart @f{\widetilde{U}}
are:
@equation[#:label "TildeFt"]{
\tilde{f}^j(t) = \tau^j(f^1(t),\ldots,f^n(t))
}
The components @f{\tilde{v}} are, again, given by (@ref{VComponents}):
@equation{
\tilde{v}^j = \left.{d\over dt}\right|_{t=0}\tilde{f}(t)
}
Applying the chain rule to (@ref{TildeFt}) we get:
@equation{
\tilde{v}^j = \sum\limits_{k=1}^n {\partial\tau^j\over\partial x^k} v^k

To summarize:
@div[redbox]{
@f{(x^1,\ldots,x^n,\;v^1,\ldots v^n)} on the chart @f{\phi: U\to M} and

@slide["Smooth maps and their derivatives" #:tag "DerivativeOfMap" #:showtitle #t]{
@section{Definition of a smooth map between manifolds}
A @bold{smooth map} @f{F:M\to N} between two manifolds is a set-theoretical map whose coordinate
functions @f{F^j(x^1,\ldots,x^m)} are smooth functions. (This is independent of the choice of a chart.)

Given two smooth maps @f{F:M\to N} and @f{G:N\to L}, the composition @f{G\circ F} is again a smooth map.
@section{Derivative of a smooth map}
For a smooth map @f{F:M\to N}, we will now define the @bold{derivative map} @f{F_*:TM\to TN}.

A point of @f{TM} is a pair @f{(x,v)}, where @f{x\in M} and @f{v\in T_xM}. We define:
@equation{
F_*((x,v)) = (F(x),\; w)
}
where @f{w\in T_{F(x)}N} is defined as follows. Let @f{f(t)} be a trajectory in @f{M}, starting at @f{x}
with the velocity @f{v}. We define @f{w} as the velocity vector of the trajectory @f{F(f(t))}.

@bold{Exercise @ex-num{CorrectnessOfDefDerivativeMap}:} Show that this definition does not depend on
the choice of a trajectory @f{f(t)} representing the velocity vector @f{v}; @italic{i.e.} any other trajectory 
@f{g(t)} satisfying (@ref{oSmallOft}) would result in the same @f{w}.

@section{Formula for derivative in coordinates}
Now, suppose that @f{x\in M} is covered by a chart @f{\phi:U\to M} and @f{F(x)\in N} is covered
by a chart @f{\psi:V\to M}. Then we can calculate the coordinates of @f{w} using (@ref{VComponents})
and express them through the coordinates of @f{v}. We get:
@equation[#:label "DerivativeMapInCoordinates"]{
F_*((x,v)) = \left(F^1(x),\ldots,F^n(x)\;,\; \sum\limits_k {\partial F^1\over \partial x^k} v^k,
\ldots, \sum\limits_k {\partial F^1\over \partial x^k} v^k\right)
}
Notice that @f{w} depends on @f{v} @bold{linearly}.
}

@slide["Category of smooth manifolds" #:tag "CategoryOfSmoothManifolds" #:showtitle #t]{
Now suppose that we have three smooth manifolds, @f{M,N,L} and smooth maps @f{F:M\to N}, @f{G:N\to L}.
Then the composition @f{G\circ F} is again a smooth map. It follows immediately from our definition
of the derivative map, that:
@equation[#:label "DerivativeRespectsComposition"]{
(G\circ F)_* = G_* \circ F_*
}

@bold{Exercise @ex-num{DerivativeRespectsComposition}:} Prove (@ref{DerivativeRespectsComposition}) in 
coordinates, @italic{i.e.} using (@ref{DerivativeMapInCoordinates}).

@linebreak[]

@spn[attn]{Category} is a very important mathematical notion. It is similar to a group, but a bit weaker.

A @bold{group} is a set of elements which can be multiplied; if @f{f} and @f{g} are two elements of a group,
then we can form their product @f{f\circ g}. The product is associative:
@equation{
f\circ(g\circ h) = (f\circ g)\circ h
}
There is a unit element @f{\bf 1} such that @f{{\bf 1}\circ f = f}.  Also, for every @f{g} there is
an inverse @f{g^{-1}} such that @f{g^{-1}\circ g={\bf 1}}.

A @bold{category} @f{\cal C} has a weaker definition than a group, in the following way. 
Not any two elements can be multiplied. In fact, every
element of a category carries two labels, an in-label and and out-label. A product (or composition)
@f{F\circ G} is only defined when the in-label of @f{F} is the same as the out-label of @f{G}.

The elements of the category are called ``morphisms''.
The labels run over a set which is called @f{{\rm Ob}\;{\cal C}} --- ``the set of objects''.
The set of all morphisms which have in-label @f{A} and out-label @f{B} is called  @f{{\rm Mor}(A,B)}.
Therefore, if @f{F\in {\rm Mor}(A,B)} and @f{G\in {\rm Mor}(B,C)}, @bold{then} we can take their
product @f{G\circ F}. There should exist @f{{\bf 1}_{A}\in {\rm Mor}(A,A)} for every @f{A\in{\rm Ob}\;{\cal C}}.
 
@div[comment]{
An example of a category is the set of all rectangular matrices. 
In this case @f{{\rm Ob}\;{\cal C} = \{1,2,3,\ldots\}} and @f{{\rm Mor}(m,n)} is
the set of all matrices with @f{n} rows and @f{m} columns. The composition is the product of matrices.
}

A @bold{functor} between two categories is the analogue of @bold{homomorphism} between two groups:
@tabular[@list[
 @list[
@hspace[4]@f{{\cal F}: {\rm Ob} {\cal C} \to {\rm Ob} {\cal D}} ""
]@list[
@hspace[4]@f{{\cal F}: {\rm Mor}(A,B) \to {\rm Mor}({\cal F}(A),{\cal F}(B))} @elem{@hspace[3](the same letter @f{{\cal F}} is used)}
]
]]
such that @f{{\cal F}(F\circ G) = {\cal F}(F)\circ {\cal F}(G)}.

@linebreak[]
Smooth maps between manifolds form a category, let us denote it @f{{\cal M}}. In this case
@f{{\rm Ob}\;{\cal M}} is the set of all smooth manifolds, and 
@f{{\rm Mor}\;(M,N)} is the set of all smooth maps between @f{M} and @f{N}.

The construction of tangent bundle is an example of a functor, from @f{{\cal M}} to @f{{\cal M}}
(in fact, it is a functor from the category of smooth manifolds to the category of vector bundles;
we will discuss vector bundles later). For every manifold @f{M}, we get @f{TM}. And for every
map @f{F}, we get @f{F_*} which would be better to denote @f{TF}:

@div[redbox]{
For a derivative of a smooth map @f{F}, we will sometimes use the notation @f{TF\;} instead of @f{F_*}
This operation respects the composition of morphisms, as a functor should --- see Eq. (@ref{DerivativeRespectsComposition})
